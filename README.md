# Input

The MyResume web application is built using React, where the input consists of personal data such as name, contact information, education, skills, work experience, and projects. This data is hardcoded into the Resume.js component as structured JavaScript objects and JSX elements.

# Process

The core process involves the React component structure. The App.js file serves as the root component and imports the Resume.js component, which further applies CSS styling from Resume.css. When the development server (npm start) is run, React dynamically renders the data, ensuring a structured layout. The CSS file styles the content by setting fonts, margins, and colors.

# Output

The final output is a visually formatted resume webpage displayed in the browser. It presents the userâ€™s details in a clear, styled layout, with headings, sections, and proper alignment as defined in the CSS file. The background color, fonts, and text alignment match the provided design specifications.
